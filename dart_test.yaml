# This package's tests are very slow. Double the default timeout.
timeout: 2x

# The tests are done with firefox because chrome is
# often added as a stable prefix in third-party linux
# distributions and firefox is almost always in the default distribution repositories.
#
# Build_runner calls google-chrome, but with the prefix.
# it turns out google-chrome-stable, which makes build_runner unable to run the tests.
#
# The best solution at the moment, is to change the platform from chrome to firefox.
platforms: [firefox]
