## Introduction

Reio is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally
adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an
approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you
tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.
